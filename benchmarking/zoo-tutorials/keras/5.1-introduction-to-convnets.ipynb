    "through in Chapter 2, using a densely-connected network (our test accuracy then was 97.8%). Even though our convnet will be very basic, its \n",
    "accuracy will still blow out of the water that of the densely-connected model from Chapter 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 6 lines of code below show you what a basic convnet looks like. It's a stack of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers. We'll see in a \n",

    "Importantly, a convnet takes as input tensors of shape `(image_height, image_width, image_channels)` (not including the batch dimension). \n",

    "passing the argument `input_shape=(28, 28, 1)` to our first layer."
